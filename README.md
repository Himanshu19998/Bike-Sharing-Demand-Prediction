# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
Description:
This programming assignment focuses on building a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. Using a dataset provided by a US bike-sharing provider, BoomBikes, the goal is to understand the factors influencing bike demand post-pandemic lockdown. The assignment involves data preparation, model building, and evaluation using the R-squared score.

Problem Statement:
BoomBikes aims to understand the demand for shared bikes post-quarantine to strategize their business plan accordingly. They seek to identify significant variables predicting bike demand and assess how well these variables describe demand patterns. The company's objective is to model bike demand based on various factors and leverage the insights to optimize their business strategy and meet customer expectations effectively.

Insights:

1. Fall season exhibits the highest rental bike demand, with 2019 showing greater demand compared to the previous year.
2. Demand increases consistently from January to September, followed by a decrease in subsequent months.
3. Holidays and weekends experience higher demand compared to working days.
4. Good weather conditions correlate with higher demand, while bad weather conditions result in lower demand.
5. The top three features contributing significantly to bike demand are Year (Yr), Feels Like Temperature (atemp), and Season (Spring). These variables play a crucial role in explaining the variation in bike demand and can guide business decisions effectively.
